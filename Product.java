/*
 * This class is used for gathering information about each individual product
 * The variable and method names are extensive to ensure full explanation for what each is used for
 * 
 * The math behind reliability is:
 * New value of reliability rating = ((Old value of reliability rating * Old number of customers before rating) + Reliability rating by this customer) / New number of customers after rating.
 * when a rating is not between 1 and 5 it will not be registered and a message describing that the given rating is not acceptable for the product will be given
 * 
 * There is no default constructor, at the very minimum a model and manufacturer name is required
 * 
 * there are only two set methods (overall rating and retail price) but there are get methods for every instance variable
