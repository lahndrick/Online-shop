/*
 * This class is the main class used by the user
 * 
 * It uses the OnlineShop and Product classes to create a shop with products in it
 * 
 * The beggining of main is simply creating 5 products and creating some ratings for these products
 * 
 * What the user sees is an infinite loop that will keep looping until the user enters "C" (lower or upper case)
 * 
 * The options for the user are to display the products in the store, rate the products or exit
 * if exit is chosen the product is closed
 * if display is chosen it displays the products in the store then asks the user for a chosen option again
 * if rating a product is chosen they will then be prompted to select which product followed by what they want to rate the product
